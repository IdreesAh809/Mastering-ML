# 📊 Telco Customer Churn Prediction (Learning Project)

This is a simple beginner-level machine learning project created for learning purposes. It uses an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** to perform **binary classification** and predict whether a telecom customer will churn or not.

---

## ✅ Objective

- Learn how to handle real-world tabular data.
- Build a neural network using TensorFlow/Keras.
- Predict customer churn as a binary classification task (`Yes` or `No`).

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used is **Telco Customer Churn**, available on Kaggle:

🔗 [Download Dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)

Download and place the file `WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv` in the same folder as the notebook.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Open the Jupyter notebook file:  
   `Customer_Churn_ANN.ipynb`

2. Run the cells step-by-step to:
   - Load and explore the dataset
   - Preprocess the data
   - Train an ANN model
   - Evaluate its performance

---

## 📈 Task Type

- **Binary Classification**  
  Predicts whether a customer will **churn (`Yes`)** or **not churn (`No`)**.

---

## 📚 Learning Outcome

- Practice preprocessing for categorical and numerical features.
- Build and train a simple neural network.
- Evaluate a binary classification model using accuracy and confusion matrix.
