# Titanic Survival Prediction ðŸš¢

This project predicts passenger survival on the Titanic using machine learning models.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
- `data/processed/` - Contains the cleaned dataset.
- `models/` - Stores the trained models.
- `Titanic_Model_Training.ipynb` - Colab notebook for model training.

## ðŸ”§ Steps in the Project
1. **Load and preprocess data** - Handle missing values and encode categorical features.
2. **Train multiple models** - Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, KNN, Gradient Boosting.
3. **Evaluate models** - Compare accuracy and performance.
4. **Save the best model** - The model with the highest accuracy is saved.

## ðŸ“Š Best Model
The best-performing model is automatically saved in the `models/` folder.

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Open the notebook.
2. Run each step sequentially.
3. The best model will be saved in `/models/`.
